      <h1>Welcome to Barasoc</h1>
      <p>Barasoc is a cyber security company based in Canberra, Australia that provides solutions to defend against cyber threats. Today, the security of IT systems involves protecting systems and information through detection, prevention, and response to illegal access from inside and outside your enterprise. Once any IT system gets compromised by hackers, this can result in sensitive-information being altered, stolen, destroyed, misused, or can result in physical system damage, for example, surveillance cameras stopped working or temperature sensor reporting wrong readings.</p>
      <p>Recently, the world has seen an increase in cyber attacks, from ransomware attacks to supply chain attacks, which highlights the importance of having a robust security system in place. At Barasoc, we specialize in building incident response plans and Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to protect our clients against these threats. Our services include Penetration Testing, Threat Assessment, Cybersecurity Training, and Research & Development.</p>
      <p>The role of a SOC is to monitor and analyze an organization's security posture, detect threats, and respond to security incidents. By having a SOC, businesses can proactively identify vulnerabilities and threats, and take measures to mitigate them. At Barasoc, we can help businesses set up a cheap SOC and provide them with incident response capability.</p>
      <p>If you need to speak with us about anything related to cybersecurity, including training, jobs, businesses, and research & development opportunities, please contact our volunteer CEO, Dr. Waqas Haider, at waqasbtn@gmail.com.</p>
