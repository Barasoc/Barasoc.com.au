			<h2>Welcome to BaraSOC</h2>
			<p>BaraSOC is a cyber-security company based in Canberra Australia that provides solutions to defend against cyber threats. Today, the security of IT systems involves protecting systems and information through detection, prevention and response to illegal access from inside and outside your enterprise. Once any IT system gets compromised by hackers, this can result in sensitive information being altered, stolen, destroyed, misused or can result in a physical system damage, for example, surveillance cameras stopped working or temperature sensor reporting wrong readings.</p>
			
			<p>Due to the complexity of attack vectors, there is no IT system or product that can be considered perfectly secure and no single product, service or security measure can be entirely effective in preventing cyber-attacks. BaraSOC products and services are designed according to the defence in depth principle which necessarily involves building multiple layers of defence using people, policies and technology.</p>
			
			<p>BaraSOC is providing a wide variety of cyber security services and products aiming to:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#services">Identify-report risk using onsite-remote-automated pentesting service</a></li>
				<li><a href="#services">Decrease data breach risk and extend security intelligence with in-depth data defense</a></li>
				<li><a href="#services">Provide a streamlined and adaptable solution for real-time monitoring access to high-value databases, data warehouses, files, cloud and big-data environments</a></li>
				<li><a href="#services">Minimize total cost of ownership with robust scalability, simplification, automation, analytics and transparency for a range of deploymentsâ€”whether they are small, large or enterprise-wide improper use or access.</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>IBM systems, products and services are designed to be part of a lawful, comprehensive security approach, which will necessarily involve additional operational procedures, and may require other systems, products or services to be most effective. BaraSOC provides Security Operation Centre services to other organizations or assists them with developing their own SOC.</p>
